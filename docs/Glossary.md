# Glossary
**Geo Gala: Vector Offensive**

---

## A

**Auto-fire**
Continuous weapon firing without holding input. Default enabled on mobile.

**Arcade**
Game design philosophy prioritizing immediate fun, quick sessions, and high replayability over complex narratives.

## B

**Boss Wave**
Special wave appearing every 10 waves featuring a large enemy with unique mechanics.

**Bullet Ballet**
Game design focusing on elegant dodging patterns and rhythm in combat.

## C

**Canvas 2D**
HTML5 rendering API used for all game graphics via `<canvas>` element.

**Combo Multiplier**
Score bonus that increases with consecutive enemy kills (max 5.0×).

**CSP (Content Security Policy)**
HTTP header restricting resource loading to prevent XSS attacks.

## D

**DPR (Device Pixel Ratio)**
Ratio between physical pixels and CSS pixels (e.g., 2× on Retina displays).

**Dive Attack**
Enemy behavior: break formation → attack player → retreat.

## E

**ECS (Entity-Component-System)**
Architecture pattern separating data (components) from logic (systems).

**ES Modules**
Modern JavaScript module system (`import`/`export` syntax).

## F

**Faction**
Geometric enemy type representing a mathematical principle (Order, Chaos, Fractal, Singularity).

**FPS (Frames Per Second)**
Rendering update frequency. Target: 60 FPS.

**Formation**
Predefined pattern enemies enter in (Wedge, Grid, Spiral, Pincer, Swarm).

## G

**Glow Effect**
Visual rendering technique using `shadowBlur` to create neon aesthetic.

**Gamepad API**
Browser API for controller input support.

## H

**Heat Mechanic**
Weapon limitation: continuous firing builds heat → overheat prevents shooting.

**HMR (Hot Module Replacement)**
Vite feature allowing code updates without full page reload.

**HUD (Heads-Up Display)**
On-screen UI showing score, health, heat, power level.

## I

**Invulnerability Frames (i-frames)**
Brief period of damage immunity after player is hit (1.5s).

**Input Abstraction**
Code layer normalizing keyboard/touch/gamepad into unified movement vector.

## L

**LocalStorage**
Browser API for client-side data persistence (settings, high scores).

**Lighthouse**
Google tool for auditing web performance, accessibility, SEO.

## M

**MCP (Model Context Protocol)**
Framework for AI agent tool usage (file operations, GitHub integration).

**MVP (Minimum Viable Product)**
Core feature set for initial release (30 waves, basic weapons).

**Magnet Field**
Player ability pulling nearby pickups automatically.

## N

**Neon Aesthetic**
Visual style: glowing vectors on dark backgrounds (Geometry Wars meets Tron).

**Nuke**
Screen-clearing special ability (1 per 5 waves).

## O

**Object Pooling**
Memory optimization: reuse entity instances instead of creating/destroying.

**Overheat**
Weapon state triggered at 100% heat; forces 2s cooldown.

## P

**Power Level**
Weapon upgrade tier (0-10) affecting shot count and pattern.

**Pickup**
Collectible dropped by enemies (Power Crystal, Heat Sink, Repair Kit, etc.).

**PWA (Progressive Web App)**
Web app installable on devices with offline support (Phase 3).

**Painter's Algorithm**
Rendering order: background → entities → VFX → HUD.

## R

**Responsive Design**
UI adapting to screen size (mobile-first approach).

**ROF (Rate of Fire)**
Shots per second (e.g., Pulse Cannon = 15/s).

**Reactor System**
Game loop managing update/render at fixed timestep.

## S

**Spatial Hash Grid**
Collision optimization dividing game space into cells.

**Synergy Node**
Passive upgrade modifying weapon/movement (Coolant Injector, Magnet Field).

**Semantic Versioning (SemVer)**
Version format: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH (e.g., 1.2.3).

## T

**Telemetry**
Anonymous gameplay data collection (wave reached, session length).

**Touch Controls**
Virtual joystick + button interface for mobile devices.

**Token (Design Token)**
CSS variable storing design system value (colors, spacing).

## V

**Vite**
Frontend build tool providing dev server with HMR and production bundling.

**VFX (Visual Effects)**
Particles, explosions, screen shake rendered separately from gameplay.

**Virtual Joystick**
On-screen touch control mimicking analog stick.

## W

**Wave**
Game level unit: enemies spawn → player defeats them → next wave.

**Weapon Core**
Modular weapon type (Pulse Cannon, Rail Spike, etc.) with unique mechanics.

**Web Audio API**
Browser API for low-latency sound playback and music.

## X

**XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)**
Security vulnerability: injecting malicious scripts via user input.
