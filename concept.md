# Geo Gala: Vector Offensive

 Geo Gala: Vector Offensive is a modern re-imagining of the *Chicken Invaders* formula, rebuilt around clean geometry and neon precision rather than cartoon poultry and 3-D ships.

## 🧩 Core Idea

You pilot a stylized **triangle fighter** in a war among intelligent geometric factions—triangles, squares, hexes, and prisms—each representing a mathematical “species.” The game keeps the **arcade purity** of fixed-shooters like *Galaga* and *Chicken Invaders*: waves enter in formation, break into attack runs, and the goal is to clear each wave while upgrading your ship.

## ⚙️ Gameplay Philosophy

* **Readable combat:** every shape telegraphs its movement and attack style through silhouette and color.
* **Deep upgrade loop:** instead of poultry power-ups, you evolve modular weapon cores, synergy nodes, and reactor systems that radically change your firing pattern.
* **Rhythmic flow:** waves arrive with musical cadence—calm formation, hectic dive, triumphant clear—creating that signature “one-more-wave” feel.

## 🎨 Visual & UI Direction

* **Theme:** glowing vectors on dark backgrounds—think *Geometry Wars* meets *Tron*.
* **Scaling:** mobile-first responsive design with pixel-perfect translation to fullscreen desktop; no letterboxing.
* **UI:** modernized *Chicken Invaders* layout—top HUD bar for score, power, and heat; large tactile controls for mobile; fluid auto-scaling on desktop.

## 🚀 Player Experience

The player moves freely within screen bounds, dodging and weaving through geometric swarms while managing **weapon heat** and limited-use **missiles/nukes**. Power levels increase shot count and pattern complexity. Passive systems like a **pickup magnet** and overheat cooldown add tactical rhythm.

---

## 🌌 Tone & Story

Instead of slapstick humor, *Geo Gala* frames the conflict as an **abstract cosmic rivalry**—a festival of shapes at war over symmetry itself. Each faction embodies a mathematical principle (Order, Chaos, Fractal, Singularity), turning every battle into a clash of design philosophies.

---

In short: **Geo Gala** takes the joyful arcade pacing of *Chicken Invaders* and refines it into a sleek, geometry-driven bullet ballet—simple to play, endlessly replayable, and visually hypnotic across devices.
